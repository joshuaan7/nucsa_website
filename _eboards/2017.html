    Hello all! My name is Ed and I am currently a second year Marketing major. As Public Relations, I aim to be someone you feel comfortable reaching out to even if it is just to talk! I have lived my life through mantras of self-improvement but also humility. In my free time, I enjoy powerlifting, tennis and consuming sushi. I expect great things out of all us and cannot wait to see where our potential takes us for the upcoming year!
