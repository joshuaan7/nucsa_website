      So, a few things about me.  I am a second year student studying Computer Science.  Being a Computer Science major, I spend a lot of time programming for classes, but I also use my free time to work on my <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cyvuong">personal software projects</a>.  An example of this is [the old] CSA website, which I designed and coded over Winter Break 2012.  Outside of things related to my major, my interests include singing, playing the guitar (see my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MoonlightTurtle">Youtube Channel</a>), cooking, and video games.  In case anyone is wondering, I am Chinese, specifically of Cantonese origin, but I have a Vietnamese last name (My actual surname is Wong or Wang in Mandarin). My parents are both Chinese, but lived in Vietnam, so when they came over after the Vietnam War, their names were transliterated into English using the Vietnamese equivalents of their Chinese names.  I am proud of my Chinese American heritage and continue to discover more about myself and my culture everyday.  I hope to lay the groundwork this year to build a lasting community at Northeastern where this is made possible.  I am excited to work with all of the talented members on CSA's very first executive board!

      I am a first year Pharmacy student minoring in Business Administration. I was born in China, but grew up in Flushing, New York. Having been raised in a community where the bubble tea industry blooms, drinking bubble tea has become almost a daily thing (burns quite a hole in my wallet), even since coming to live in Boston. My interests include karaoking (though if how good I am at it is questionable), watching Korean dramas, playing volleyball, eating anything with chocolate, exploring new places, and trying new things. I am hoping to use my experiences, as well as new ideas, to devise exciting activities in order to create an engaging learning experience and interactive community for the members of this organization.

      I'm a second year pharmacy major and am an avid redditor. I volunteer at Brigham and Women's hospital, and I like to play tennis and swim. One of my goals this year as Public Relations Officer is to foster unity in the Chinese-American identity to create a more active student body on campus.
