    I'm a first generation Chinese American from Southborough, Massachusetts. When I'm not at CSA meetings or events you can find me exploring the city of Boston, playing guitar, doing yoga, or pretending to be a merman. I can't wait to meet all of you and look forward to another amazing year with CSA.

    I'm a 2nd year INFP; Interaction Design major (you can try to ask me what this means); and your proud Media Specialist. You can often find me in the library watching CollegeHumor, designing posters, learning web design, and discussing Chinese dramas (sometimes but not always in that order).
