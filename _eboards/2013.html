      Hey everyone! So before you ask, no.. I'm not Chinese. Look on the right of the photo and you'll find me. Or you can search the city because there's nowhere else I'd rather be! As a dabbler at heart, I love picking up hobbies. Photography, bicycling, longboarding, jammin' the uke, yelping, pen spinning, speed cubing, airbrushing, art-crafting, and more! If you couldn't tell from my major, some might say I'm a bit of a nerd (or smart*ss). Personal life aside, I'm interested in the Chinese American presence on campus and its differences from other Asian American groups.

      I was born and raised in New York City. I am a Chinese American who speaks Cantonese and English. I had actually transferred into Northeastern University as a Sophomore with intentions on pursuing a law career in the future. I joined CSA because I wanted to immerse in an emerging and engaging body of students in Northeastern.

      Hello everyone! I'm an American born Chinese from New York City. I've lived in NYC all my life but decided to experience a different kind of city in my college years, which brings me here to Boston. A little bit about myself, I love doing crafty projects and have a soft spot for animals. I really enjoy talking to people about… well anything! With that being said, don't be shy to talk and get to know me! I know I may look intimidating (from what I've heard) but I promise I'm not! Aside from all of this personal stuff, I'm excited to be on e-board for CSA's first official year and I foresee a lot of great events and opportunities for you guys!

      Although I consider myself Chinese American, I spent most of my life living in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore. My family's current home is in Singapore, but we are actually from New York. Some of my favorite things to do are photography, cooking, scuba diving, snowboarding, traveling and eating good food! I am looking to help CSA begin to achieve a deep presence in the Northeastern community and to help spread awareness of our culture!

      I was born and raised in Boston. I am a sophomore at Northeastern University, majoring in Business with a concentration in Marketing. I love to eat and am always up for trying new restaurants. I love anything that is spicy. Desserts are my favorite type of food. On my free time I like to go shopping, go on Youtube, discovering new music, and learning how to make desserts. I am excited to be part of the executive board for NUCSA and looking forward to letting people know about the newest club at Northeastern!

      Hey all! I’m a Chinese-American studying Computer Science here at Northeastern. My interests include video production, photo manipulation, photography, game development, programming, and using technology to make awesome things in general! The high school I went to was <1% Asian so CSA is my medium for getting in touch with the Asian and Asian-American community around me now that there actually is one. I'm looking forward to working with everyone this year!
