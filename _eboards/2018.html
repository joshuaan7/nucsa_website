       Hello friends! My name is Timmie and I am the 2018-19 President for CSA. I'm very excited to start CSA events and creating memories with all of you guys! When I'm not doing CSA or Pre-med things, you can find me hanging out with friends, trying new places to eat (EWD), or passed out on my couch at home. You will rarely find me at Marino or Squashbusters because I am a potato. Feel free to pm me on FB for any questions or if you want to hang out!

       Hi! My name is Lily and I'm a third year business major, concentrating in management and minoring in communication studies. When I'm out and about you're most likely to find me at Matthew's (I'm on the club skating team here), searching for new places to eat, or hanging out with friends. This will be my third year serving on CSA’s e-board, so if you have any questions feel free to reach out.

       Hi my name is Ethan Fong and I’m a first year finance major. My interest for finance was really fostered at a young age. I grew up with the support of my uncles and I often asked them what they did at their job. Whether it was relating to stocks or consulting cases I knew business was going to be in my future career.  In addition, I would consider myself a very family oriented person. My family is the most important thing to me and I find it invaluable to have that support system. Becoming treasurer has really allowed me to couple my interest in finance with creating a family within CSA. I’m so excited for what the future will hold and look forward to serving as treasurer!

       I think it is important to live a balanced life. I love to exercise and go on adventures. On  the other hand, I also like spending a day in bed watching Netflix. I have yet to try a lot of restaurants around Boston so come try out new restaurants with me! I can't wait to meet you.

       Hi! I'm a 4th year graduating business major who's switched her major more times than necessary. I love to travel and eat and that's pretty much all I do, so if either those sound interesting to you, don't be afraid to reach out!

       Hi everyone! My name is Cat and I'm your committee chair for this year! I'm pretty shy at first but I swear I'm kind of cool. I'm always down to do whatever, and you can usually find me studying in Snell or sleeping. Please don't be afraid to reach out, I'm always here to talk! It's pronounced pen-guin not pain-guin, scereal is a soup, and poptarts are ravioli. Change my mind. I'm so excited to meet all of you!
