    Hi everyone! I'm a small-town New Hampshire girl who's been shipped into the city for college, and to my surprise, life is so much more interesting here! Things I enjoy include forum browsing, shopping, a good debate, the thought of being environmentally friendly (I'm still working on it), artsy activities, and electronic music. CSA has become near and dear to my heart, and I'm super excited to see what this year will bring. Strike up a conversation with me at any event or gathering, or if you see me walking around, and I'll probably respond! I'm always up for having a good time, so let's get started on that, shall we? :)

    I am a 4th Year Political Science Major in Northeastern University, and I was originally a transfer student. I had first majored in English before switching to Political Science. I was born and raised in New York City! I am a Chinese American who speaks English and Cantonese! Believe it or not, Cantonese was my first language, even though I primarily use English now. Still to this day, I have never visited Hong Kong or China, even though I would love to! I try my best to connect with my culture and heritage alongside friends and family! In terms of hobbies, I love traveling, sports, and drawing! I have many hobbies, and I love trying out new things!

    Hey everybody. I'm a first generation Chinese American from Southborough, Massachusetts. When I'm not at CSA meetings or events you can find me swimming at the Barletta Natatorium or exploring the city of Boston. My interests include playing guitar, breakdancing, yoga, piña coladas and getting caught in the rain. I can't wait to meet all of you and look forward to another amazing year with CSA.

    Hello! My name is Stephanie and I am excited to be helping CSA plan fun events for this year! A little bit about me – although my last name is Vietnamese, I speak Chinese. I am a transfer student from Rutgers University. I am slightly obsessed with corgis and cats on the Internet. I love to eat and try new foods, so feel free to hang out and eat with me! I can also be found at Club Snell almost every night, so feel free to join me there too :)

    AHey CSA-er's!! I'm super excited to be your Cultural Chair for the 2014-2015 period! :] Hmm… about myself. I'm a first generation Boston-born half Chinese, half Viet American, who's lived in Boston all my life. I aspire to do something big with my life in the business world (not sure what yet, haha). In my free time, I enjoy watching Hong Kong dramas, playing games, buying food (veggies!), making water balloons but most importantly, I love spending time with family and friends (it's what I live for). Looking forward to making everyone smile this year! Feel free to chat me up with questions, comments, or concerns! (Or if you just want to hang out :D)

    Hey everyone! I'm a 2nd year Husky from San Francisco, California. I identify as Asian-American, but I spend a lot of time in Hong Kong with my family and I love to travel! I'm a passionate musician and in my free time I enjoy trying new foods, socializing, watching films, and running. Also, I have an unhealthy obsession with boba and tofu… Anyway, I'm so honored to be an active part of the Asian-American community here at Northeastern University. I hope everyone can feel at home with CSA, and I hope to spread cultural awareness in the greater community. Feel free to approach me and chat about anything! Welcome to CSA! :)
